Warning:
========

1. Don't use the 'Makefile' in the root directory. It is generated
   by STM32CubeMX, which is not maintained.

2. Don't use the STM32CubeMX directly. It only gives you a reference
   to my configurations.

3. Only low speed mode can support the motor position rebound test.
   Otherwise, the motor will be damaged.

Note:
========

1. Wait until the LED off and then start the motor. Otherwise, you
   may cause an undefined situation.

2. If the motor suddenly stops, it may be now protected by the DRV8313,
   you need to pull off the battery to release the fault state of DRV8313.

3. Torque needs to be greater than 0.6 under current loop control
